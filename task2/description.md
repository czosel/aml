For this task, the description of what we did is actually quite short: We got the best results by first applying a StandardScaler and after training a simple SVC model with RBF kernel. We performed extensive hyperparameter optimization using a random cross-validated search for C, gamma and the class weights. The submitted model has class weights 6.5 / 1 / 6.5, which is very close to choosing "balanced" weights.

We also tried several more elaborate approaches and models: One of them was a separate analysis of building model out of smaller, separately trained one-vs-all and one-vs-one models that were applied in a specific sequence, e.g. first using a one-vs-all classifier to decide if the sample belongs to the majority class or not, and after (if it doesn't) applying a one-vs-one to decide the minority class. Additionally, several other algorithms were tried (e.g. GaussianNB, KNN, XGB, LGBM, CatBoost, Deep neural nets) but none of the approaches yielded comparable results to the simple SVC one. Also applying feature selection using PCA didn't improve our results.
